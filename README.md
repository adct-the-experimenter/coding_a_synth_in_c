# coding_a_synth_in_c
Sourced the initial development from perky and basically made it simpler for my brain to wrap around how that can be integrated into a game engine.

So basiclaly it was designed to hook up to MIDI only and that requires a makeover.

The goal is to add instrument profiles, ADSR, and noise.

Then expand on the modulation, mostly pitch an damplitude.

Again everything needs to be moved into a way we can simply trigger sounds without midi and then create a sequencer for it so we can write sound effects and tunes.
